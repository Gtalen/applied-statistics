## Standard Normal Distribution and degree of freedom
## ddof
ddof means degree of freedom ddof=1 is used for calculating the sample standard devaition while ddof=0 is used to calculate the population standard deviation as described by [tidystat](https://tidystat.com/when-to-use-ddof1-in-np-std/) and in the official [numpy.std](https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/generated/numpy.std.html) documentation.
